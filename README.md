Project Description — Aawaaz
Aawaaz is a privacy-first decentralized platform designed to protect investigative journalists while restoring ownership, safety, and independence in modern journalism.
Journalists reporting on corruption, organized crime, war zones, financial fraud, and political misconduct often face surveillance, censorship, threats, and even assassination. Traditional publishing systems expose their identities and place editorial control in centralized institutions, leaving reporters vulnerable and undercompensated.
Secure-Report solves this by leveraging blockchain, decentralized identity, and zero-knowledge technology to create a secure reporting infrastructure.
The platform allows journalists to:
Verify themselves using decentralized identity without revealing personal information.
Publish investigative articles anonymously while maintaining verifiable authorship.
Mint stories as on-chain assets, ensuring proof of ownership and censorship resistance.
Build reputation and track engagement metrics privately across publications.
Monetize their work directly without dependence on centralized media houses.
Media organizations and newspapers can:
Discover verified investigative stories through a decentralized marketplace.
Identify high-impact journalists based on engagement and credibility metrics.
Acquire publishing rights transparently through on-chain minting mechanisms.
By combining privacy, identity verification, and decentralized publishing, Secure-Report creates a new communication layer between journalists and publishers — one that prioritizes safety, truth, and creator ownership.
Our vision is to enable journalists anywhere in the world to investigate freely, publish securely, and be rewarded fairly without risking their lives or losing control of their work.
